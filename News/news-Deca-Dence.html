          <p>Hello and welcome to Anime Fan Helper. 2020 was a tough year for everyone. COVID-19, lock downs, Trump’s bullshit, BLM movement, my Logic Board dying (lost all my data), & etc. It was one crazy year. Though all this never ending shit. When new anime where shut down across the board. There was at least one amazing anime that came out after the pandemic started. That was Deco-Dance. It brought hope this past summer to a world of despair. It did this by blowing your fucking mind by episode two. It is a spatular anime. With the  animation on par with any great master piece work of art that came before it. Although that not that uncommon now days. But what really lets it stand out was it’s original story. The story does have it faults. It’s biggest in my opinion is it is only 12 episodes and can easy have been a 24 episode with more fun stand alone episodes that help with the world building. But COIVD-19 happen so it only has 12 episodes and instead of world      building those a long running story. Some of the episodes have narrator voice over at the opening sequence explain stuff. The story told in those 12 episodes is truly amazing. Well worth the watch.

          <p>Deca-Dance is set in a post apocalyptic world with the remnants of humanity living, working, and fighting on a giant moving fortress called Deca-Dance. The fortress also turns in to a huge fist to punch giant monsters. Humans are broken in to two groups. Gears, who fight the monsters. and Tankers, who can’t fight. Tankers work normal jobs in and on Deco-Dance. The monsters are called Gadoll. Gadoll are monster creatures that come in a verity of different types. They create gravity fields around them making a need for special skills and weapon to kill them. The blood of the Gadoll also acts as a fuel to power vehicle and Deca-Dance. Gear use pipes that they shoot into the Gadoll to get the blood out.

          <p>Now on to spoiling the shit out of Deca-Dance. If you don’t care about me spoiling a huge plot twist then read on or stop watch episode 1 - 3 and then come back and finish reading. You been warned. So Deca-Dance is not what you think it is at all. It is in reality a video game. Yep I type that correct, a video game. It was created and is operated by the Quake corporation. At one point in history, humans made cyborgs and they started to out number the humans. A program created Deca-Dance as a way to entertain the cyborgs. Deca-Dance takes place on what was Eurasia (Europa and Asia). You can easily tell the cyborgs from the humans. Cyborg play as different color humanoid characters in the game. The cyborgs body are all uniquely designed even the random background characters. Fast forward a few decades and we meet our main protagonist a girl name Natsume, a very optimistic and positive girl. Dispute losing her arm at a young age. She still want to be a Gear, but life is not fair, so she ends up as a Tanker. While working as a Tanker she meets Kaburagi. A man down on his luck. Although it is more like a cyborg down on his luck. Kaburagi is a pessimistic cyborg. Once a top ranking player of Deca-Dance. After a series of unfortunate events. He was sentenced to works at a bug eliminator. Bugs are beings the system deems a security risk. For humans this means those who become too close to the truth about the world of Deca-Dance being a video game. Bug hunters kill them. To hide his secret job, Kaburagi works as a Tanker and manages a section of Deca-Dance armor, cleaning & maintaining it. He is put in charge of Natsume. Natsume positive attitude starts to rub off on Kabutagi and one event leads him to finding hope in his despair. He becomes inspired to train her to become a Gear and help Natsume ultimate goal of eliminating all Gadoll. Want’s to do this because her father was killed by a Gadoll. The rest of the story follows these two those the different obstacle to achieve their goal.

        <div class="grid-item item9">There are a few other characters of note. Here are some I liked. Jill a female cyborg. She is cool and smart. She has a mysterious past and knows will to much about the inner workings of Deca-Dance. Our hero Kaburagi meet her is the Bug Correction Facility. The Bug Correction Facility is a factory where the system sends cyborgs who are deemed as bugs. I also like Minato. He is the head of Deca-Dance. He also secretly a cyborg. He is a level headed guy. He is in charge of Deca-Dance movement as well as the game play for the players. Finally I like Sarkozy. He a goofy and odd character. He befriends Kabutagi at the Bug Correction Facility. Sarkozy is a drunk who gets drunk on his own homemade alcohol. Just one more character of note I like is Kurenai. She is a total bad-ass. The most highly skilled female warrior and one of the leader of the Gears. Natsume really looks up to her.
