        <p>Hello and Welcome to Anime Fan Helper. Nowadays, there is a ton of Isekai. Well to be fair, there has been a ton of Isekai anime for a very long time.
          Isekai is one of the most popular genres in fiction. Wait one second, what the hell is an Isekai? Isekai is a Japanese word meaning a different world.
          Isekai refers to any story where the main protagonist is transported to another world. This world is oftentimes a fantasy world and there are a variety of ways one can be transported to another world.
          It is rare in this genre for the protagonist not to be on a hero journey. There is a diagram below explaining the hero journey.

        <p>Well, Log Horizon is not like the typical Isekai. For one, it falls under a sub-genre of Isekai known as the gamer Isekai. Gamer Isekai is niche anime and manga targeted towards gamers and that sort.
          The basic premise is what you would think a gamer Isekai would be about. A typical gamer Isekai is about a gamer getting trapped in the game they are playing.
          99% of the time no matter what journey they are on, the ultimate goal is to find out who sent them there and how to get home. This is pretty much the target of all Isekai which kind of makes no sense to me.
          I mean you're transported into the world of your favorite game and you want to go home? Often times, the protagonist would be some hot head charging forward without a care in the world, not a typical gamer at all.
          Log Horizon is not your typical Isekai. Log Horizon's main protagonist is Shiroe. Shiroe is a strategist.
          Wait I’m getting ahead of myself. Warning some spoilers ahead.

      <div class="body-3">
        <p> Log Horizon is an anime in which one day, 30,000 Japanese players and 300,000 players from around the world are trapped in the world of Elder Tales.
          Elder Tales is a super popular MMORPG( Massively Multiplayer Online Roll Playing Game) with millions of players worldwide. Elder Tales has been around for at least 10 years based on the events of the story.
          Log Horizon is anime based on a light novel series by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamare_Touno">Mamare Touno</a>. Mamare Touno is known for Log Horizon and Maoyu. Maoyu is an anime and light novel that I probably will cover in a future article.

      </div>
      <div class="body-4">
        <p> Anyways, Log Horizon has 2 seasons with 50 episodes in total. They came out back in 2012 and 2013. So why make a new season now? Well, the story was left unfinished.
          The reason there has not been a new Log Horizon season until now is because Mamare Touno, the author, was arrested in 2015 and charged with tax evasion for not reporting 120 million yen, about 1 million dollars USD that he made since 2010 when he started writing his light novel.
          It is kind of funny since before his arrest, both Log Horizon and Maoyu had parts including economics. There is a whole mini-arc revolving around it. Another fun fact about Log Horizon anime is it was not done by a single studio.
          Season 1 is by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satelight">Satelight studio</a> and season 2 is by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Deen">Studio Dean</a>. Season 3 is also going to be by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Deen">Studio Dean</a>. Both studios are very good at what they do.

      </div>
      <div class="body-5">
        <p>As I was saying before, one day players from all over the world were transported to another world. So here is where the story differs from most Isekai. The players start by waking up in Elder Tales. We began the story with Shiroe.
          I think this is a good spot to stop until part 2. Please support Anime Fan Helper by going to the links below.
