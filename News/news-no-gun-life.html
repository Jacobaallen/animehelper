        <p>Hello and welcome to Anime Fan Helper. Today, we are taking a look at No Gun Life, an anime not even 4 kids could sensor. The reason is the main character, Juzo. He literally has a gun as a head. His head is modeled on a classic revolver. Makes ya wonder where are his eyes? I’m getting ahead of myself.

        <p>(Warning: Some Spoilers Ahead)
          So back to what I was saying. Juzo is a hardboiled detective with a gun for a head. Juzo is what they call an Extenzed human. An Extenzed is a person with cybernetic body modifications. The story is set up as a classic detective story. It takes place in the future where the government and one mega corporation reigns supreme.
          The Berühren Corp is your typical bad guy in company form.

      </div>
      <div class="body-4">
        <p>Anyways, the story takes place after a great war. Not much is known about the great war except that Extenzed humans were researched and used on a massive level. Juzo was part of a special group called the Gun Slave Unit. Humans were given powerful guns for heads that required a partner to shoot it.
          Kind of inefficient if you ask me but who’s asking? The Gun Slaves were also given other body modifications. Juzo is one the last Gun Slaves still alive.
        </p>

      <div class="body-5">
        <p>Now, Juzo works as a private eye specializing in Extenzeds cases. Juzo is joined by Merry, a talented Extenzed mechanic.  She brings jobs to Juzo and moves her office into Juzo’s building. She also helps fix Juzo any time he gets hurt on the job. She tends to just hang out with Juzo. Merry’s past is revealed in season 2.
          It is a whole bunch of stuff dealing with her brother that would be boring for you to read about. Its more fun to watch. Juzo and Merry are joined by Tetsurō Arahabaki, the son of the Berühren Corp CEO. Tetsuro was the subject of an experiment. He was given a device known as “Harmony”.
          It was implanted into his throat making him unable to speak. The device allows him to take control over a person with Extenzed as well as random robots. He meets Juzo in the first episode. In a series of events, Juzo becomes his protector.

      <div class="body-6">
        <p>Besides the main three characters, there are a few repeating side characters. The two notable ones are Juzo’s landlady and Olivier Vandeberme, the director of EMS. I get the impression Olivier has a kind of crush on Juzo. Although Olivier is the main femme fatale of the store. While each stand alone episode has there own femme fatale.

      <div class="body-7">
        <p>The character that is everyone's wifu of the season is Nezuko. Nezuko was turned in to a demon then spent the first 15 episodes asleep in a back pack. Demons can't be exposed to sun light or they die. She is a pretty useless character for the most part. All she does is motivate Taisho, but not enhance the story.
          Maybe in future seasons, she will be more helpful, but for season 1, she was useless.

      </div>
      <div class="body-8">
        <p>The series is really well animated. I bet Madhouse is saving a ton on character animation since a bunch of characters including Juzo don’t move their lips or face to talk, adding to the question, how can Juzo see?
          The story reminds me of Gintama, but without Gintama comedy. They both have 3 main characters solving different cases while being in-between good and bad guys. No Gun Life is not a comedy although it has a few comedic moments.
          I would describe it as a detective noir story set in a realistic future.

        <p>
          <p>I do recommend watching it. The characters are well grounded. The animation is amazing and the story is good. That being said it is not for everyone. It is not pretty, and it is not cute. It is hardboiled.
            Check it out. It is available on <a href="https://www.funimation.com/shows/no-guns-life/?qid=3f64794b63db20a0">Funimation</a> and where ever you pirate your anime from.
