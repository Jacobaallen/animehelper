        <p>Hello and welcome to Anime Fan Helper. You probably have never heard of Blood Blockade Battlefront also known as Kekkai Sensen. It probably will not be picked up by any major steaming service in the USA any time soon. But that's ok.
          The story is set in America and is mainly focused on one of the most famous cities in the world, Hellsalem's Lot formerly known as New York City. Yep, New York City gets blown up in one night.
          Well, more like New York City collapsed and was shrouded in a mysterious fog from the beyond. People who live there call it Hellsalem's Lot.
        </p>

      </div>
      <div class="body-2">
        <p>The manga is created, drawn, and written by Yasuhiro Nightow (link), the legendary creator of Tri-Gun.
          Blood Blockade Battlefront anime has 2 Seasons. Season 1 and 2 as well as the OVAs were created by the team at Bones Inc. (link). The first season came out back in 2015 and season 2 came out in 2017.
          OVAs have continued to come out since.

        <p> So as I was saying, the story is set in Hellsalem's Lot formerly known as New York City.  One night, the world of the beyond opens up and New York City is enveloped in an eternal fog.
          Now, monsters and all sorts of creatures call Hellsalem's Lot home, not really that much different than how New York City is now. Lol.
          They go more into this but fast forward some time to the main story and we meet our protagonist, a young photographer trying to make his way in this city.
          His name is Leonardo Watch. He is somewhat just a normal human. He works part-time jobs to pay rent. He is fearful and scared, and at times, brave and kind.
          He was gifted or cursed with the power of the All-Seeing Eyes of the Gods. He got the All-Seeing Eyes of the God power from... well you will just need to watch to find out.
          The real reason he moved to Hellsalem's Lot is to join Liberia. His reasons for wanting to join are not too clear, but it has to do with his eyes and his sister.
        </p>

      <div class="body-4">
        <p> Liberia is a secret organization that keeps the balance between this world and the beyond. The series follows the story of Liberia and really dives into them in season 2.
          Most of Liberia's main members are former/ current Fang Hunters. Fang Hunters hunt Vampires, monsters with unimaginable power. The leader of Liberia is Klaus Von Reinherz, a man with unbreakable honor and a true gentleman.
          There is also Zapp Renfro, a sleaze and upbeat guy. Zapp is kind of Leo’s bodyguard although he more annoys the heck out of Leo since Leo is not really a fighter.
          There are Chain Sumeragi, a werewolf, Steven A. Starphase, kind of second in command of Liberia, and K.K., a highly skilled sniper. There is also Gilbert F. Altstein, the butler of Reinherz's house. He followed Klaus to NYC.
          More characters join the main cast like Deldro Brody & Dog Hummer and Zed O’Brien. Each character has their own full fleshed out episode telling their story which is more fun to watch than to read about especially in this anime.
          Bones really did an outstanding job on the animation and background. It feels like New York City. The whole world feels lived in. I expect no less from the studio that did FullMetal Alchemist and is currently doing My Hero Academia. The background art alone could be in a museum. It is that good.

      </div>
      <div class="body-5">
        <p>The story in season 1 has an overarching story involving Leo with fewer free-standing episodes. They all focus on Leo as the main character. Season 2 has more stand-alone episodes focusing on individual members of Liberia.
          The episodes give character growth to the members making them more dynamic characters. I highly recommend this series. It is in fact my 3rd favorite anime of all times. You can watch it on Crunchyroll if you pay or you can watch it on kissanime.ru for free.
          As long as you quietly exit out of all pop-up ads. Well, enjoy this great anime. Be sure to leave your thoughts on it in the comments below. Did you enjoy it? Were you surprised by how good it is? Did reading this make you really want to watch it? We love to hear from you.
